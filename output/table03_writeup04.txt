In the graphs below, we illustrate the dynamics of three critical financial factors—Market Capital Factor, Book Capital Factor, and AEM Leverage Factor—from 1970 through 2012, while the second extends this data up to 2025. The Market Capital Factor exhibits noticeable volatility, with sharp spikes reflecting significant market events or shifts in investor sentiment. Conversely, the Book Capital Factor demonstrates relatively stable behavior over the entire period, indicating consistent valuation metrics based on accounting fundamentals. The AEM Leverage Factor shows pronounced intermittent volatility, particularly around significant financial crises, highlighting periods of substantial shifts in leverage and financial stress within intermediaries. These observations underscore the differing behaviors of market-based versus accounting-based measures and provide critical insights into the leverage dynamics and overall risk profile faced by financial institutions.
