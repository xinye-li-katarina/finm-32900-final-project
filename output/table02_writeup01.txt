Table 2 was compiled by Xinye and involves retrieving total assets, market equity, and other financial metrics for different categories of companies from the CRSP Compustat database. The key criterion is that these companies must be U.S.-based and have available data in CRSP Compustat. The categories include the New York Fed's primary dealers (see Table A.1), all broker-dealers, all banks, and all companies within Compustat. We examined three time periods: 1960–2012, 1960–1990, and 1990–2012.

Replicating Table 2 turned out to be far more labor-intensive than initially expected, primarily because we used data from the holding companies of primary dealers rather than the dealers themselves. This required manually verifying all 112 dealers in our list and identifying their respective holding companies during the periods they were classified as primary dealers. This was not a straightforward task, as many dealers underwent multiple ownership transfers within the specified periods.

Once the ticks.csv file—the primary query file—was completed, we extracted data from the WRDS database. This file includes all primary dealers listed in Table A.1, their holding companies, start and end dates, permcos, and gvkeys (CRSP and Compustat identifiers, respectively). While our data is quarterly, the paper's authors suggested calculating values at a monthly frequency and then taking time-series averages. To address this, I chose to forward-fill all available data within each company's active period.

After obtaining the complete primary dealer Excel file, we manually searched for the dealers' RSSDIDs on the NIC website. Additionally, we downloaded the parent-subsidiary linkage tables from WRDS to retrieve the holding companies' RSSDIDs. Subsequently, we linked these identifiers in WRDS to obtain the corresponding Permco and gvkey values. The results were promising—we successfully retrieved gvkey data for 73 companies.

For the financial dataset, we queried data based on gvkey since Table 2 specifically focuses on company-level financials, which are available in Compustat. Once we obtained correctly formatted primary dealer data—including total assets, total book debt, book equity, and market equity—we proceeded with dataset segmentation and data queries.

The first subset we constructed was for broker-dealers, which, as described in the paper, includes all primary dealers from the main dataset as well as any company with SIC codes 6211 or 6221. Using the historical link table and the primary dealer link table, we extracted this subset and retrieved financial data from Compustat. With two distinct datasets now available, we merged them based on date keys and performed ratio calculations. Specifically, we computed the total value of primary dealers divided by the sum of the total values of primary dealers and non-primary dealer broker-dealers.

We applied the same approach to the bank comparison group, which generally consists of companies with SIC code 6020. Due to data gaps and the fact that we were unable to obtain complete data for all primary dealers, the results in Table 2 tend to be slightly lower than expected. However, since the data compiled by Xinye is entirely accurate, the results from Table 03 are highly reliable.
