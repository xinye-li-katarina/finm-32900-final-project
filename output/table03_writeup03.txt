In the graphs below, we present the evolution of four key ratios—Market Capital Ratio, Book Capital Ratio, AEM Leverage Ratio, and Intermediary Capital Ratio—across two different timeframes. The first series covers the original period from 1960 to 2012, while the second extends the dataset up to 2024. By comparing these ratios over time, we can observe how market valuations, book values, and leverage measures have shifted in response to evolving economic conditions and financial market developments. These patterns provide crucial insights into changes in firms’ capital structures, their reliance on leverage, and the overall risk landscape faced by intermediaries. Understanding these historical trends is essential for both researchers and practitioners aiming to assess the stability and resilience of financial institutions under varying market environments.
